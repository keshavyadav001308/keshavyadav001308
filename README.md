## 👋 Hi, I’m Keshav Yadav

 **M.Sc. Data Science | GenAI & LLM Enthusiast | ML Engineer in the Making**
 Central University of Haryana
 I build **AI systems that actually work**, not just notebooks that look good.

  ##  About Me

I’m a **Data Science postgraduate** with a strong foundation in **Machine Learning, NLP, and Generative AI**.
I enjoy turning raw data and large language models into **real, usable products**—from spam detection systems to **LLM-powered RAG applications using Ollama**.

I believe good data science is not just about accuracy, but about **clarity, reliability, and impact**.

##  What I’m Really Good At

*  **Generative AI & LLMs** (Ollama, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering)
*  **Machine Learning & NLP&Deep Learning** (Spam detection, recommendations, text analytics)
* **Data Analysis & Visualization** (Power BI, Pandas, Matplotlib)
* **End-to-End Projects** (Data → Model → Deployment)
* **Streamlit Apps & Colab Workflows**
